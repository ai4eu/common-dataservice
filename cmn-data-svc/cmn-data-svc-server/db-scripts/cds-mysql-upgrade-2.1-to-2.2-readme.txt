ACUMOS CDS UPGRADE OF DATABASE VERSION 2.1 TO VERSION 2.2
=========================================================

This document explains how to upgrade an Acumos Common Data Service
version 2.1 database to a version 2.2 database.

Overview and Limitations
------------------------

The accompanying upgrade script defines new catalogs and migrates data
into those catalogs:

a) Solutions with revisions all at COMPANY visibility are published to
a new RESTRICTED catalog.

b) Solutions with revisions all at PUBLIC visibility are published to
a new PUBLIC catalog.

c) However, to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information, solutions
   with mixed visibility are NOT migrated.  In other words, solutions
   with some revisions at COMPANY visibility and some revisions at
   PUBLIC visibilty are left alone. Users will need to follow the new
   workflow to publish such solutions to an appropriate catalog.

Instructions
------------

Section A (Applicable for first time migration):

The script cds-mysql-upgrade-2.1-to-2.2.sql cannot be used as
provided; it must first be edited as follows:

1. Change the configuration for the new PUBLIC catalog.  You must
   choose a new ID, which is a UUID.  Generate an ID by typing the
   command "uuidgen" at the Ubuntu command line, or visit
   https://www.uuidgenerator.net/.

   Find this line:
    ('pppppppp-pppp-pppp-pppp-pppppppppppp', 'PB', 'MY PUBLIC MODELS', 
    'MY COMPANY', 'http://catalog.my.org/public', NOW(), NOW()),

   Perform a GLOBAL SEARCH AND REPLACE on all 4 occurrences of
   pppppppp-pppp-pppp-pppp-pppppppppppp with the new ID that you
   generated.

2. Change the configuration for the new RESTRICTED catalog.  Generate
a second UUID with 'uuidgen' etc.

   Find this line:
    ('rrrrrrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrrrrrrrrrr', 'RS', 'MY COMPANY MODELS', 
    'MY COMPANY', 'http://catalog.my.org/company', NOW(), NOW());

   Perform a GLOBAL SEARCH AND REPLACE on all 5 occurrences of
   rrrrrrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrrrrrrrrrr with the new ID that you
   generated, which must be different than the previous one.

3. Replicate the existing data to a new database.  For example using
the command line:

    % mysql
    > create database cds22m
    > exit
    % mysqldump cds21u | sudo mysql cds22m

4. Apply the newly edited upgrade script to the newly replicated
   database.  For example using the command line:

    % mysql
    > use cds22m;
    > source cds-mysql-upgrade-2.1-to-2.2.sql;

Section B (Applicable if you have already run 
cds-mysql-upgrade-2.1-to-2.2.sql script, published before 07/01/19, 
and now troubleshooting):

If you are left with a DB state where solutions which have all revisions
at PUBLIC or all revisions at COMPANY visibility level are migrated to 
public or restricted catalog respectively, but solutions with revisions 
across multiple visibility levels are not yet migrated, then carry out 
the following steps:

1. On CDS 2.1 DB  run the following query:
SELECT solution_id
   FROM c_solution_rev
   GROUP BY solution_id
   HAVING COUNT(distinct access_type_cd) > 1;

2. Lets say answer to the query in 1. yields S1, S2, ...Sn. Then on 
CDS 2.2 DB, run as per the following query template:

INSERT INTO c_cat_sol_map (CATALOG_ID, SOLUTION_ID, CREATED_DATE)
SELECT distinct '<restricted-catalog-id>', c_solution_rev.solution_id, NOW()
FROM c_solution_rev, c_solution
WHERE c_solution_rev.solution_id = c_solution.solution_id
      AND c_solution.ACTIVE_YN = 'Y'
      AND c_solution_rev.solution_id IN (S1, S2, ...Sn);

   Replace <restricted-catalog-id> with UUID of the existent catalog whose
   access type code is 'RS' and replace (S1, S2, ..Sn) with the list of solution
   ids from step 1.       

The final state of CDS 2.2 DB will give you the fully migrated catalog with 
solutions having both pure and mixed access type revisions.
